## Testing

[W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

* W3C markup validation service is used for the testing of the **HTML** of all 3 HTML pages and **no error** was found.

    The results can be seen here.

* [index.html](assets/docs/index-test.JPG)
* [pokemon.html](assets/docs/pokemonhtml-test.JPG)
* [contact.html](assets/docs/contacthtml-test.JPG) 
This file was showing an error that "type" is not required for javascript, So I removed the type from javascript cdn in the head element and now the page is error free.

[W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

* W3 CSS validation service is used for the testing of the **CSS** of the project and no error was found.

    The result can be seen here.

* [style.css](assets/docs/css-test.JPG)

[JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

* JSHint, a JavaScript code quality tool was used to test the **JavaScript** codes of all 3 js pages from the project.

    The result can be seen here.

* [main.js](assets/docs/mainjs-test.JPG) After running the main.js file through jsHint, some warnings were appearing, that "let" and "const" is available in ES6 or use Mozilla extension. I replaced all let and const variables by "var" and that warnings are gone. Still, some warnings about Arrow function syntax is appearing, which can be ignored.

* [pokemon.js](assets/docs/pokemonjs-test.JPG) This file is mainly made by jQuery, so when testing it through jsHint, It was showing $ as an undefined variable, this can be ignored.

* [contact.js](assets/docs/contactjs-test.JPG) This file was showing no error.

 The Project was tested for Browser compatibility. It was found that the game was not working on mobile devices, the cards were not flipping. Which was fixed by checking codes in **AutoPrefixer.github.io** and updating the CSS. That issue is resolved now.
