## **Overview**

This project is made by using famous **Pokemons**, also known as *Pocket Monsters*. They are managed by "The Pokemon Company" founded by "**Nintendo**". The purpose of this project is to make a fun memory game both for kids and adults. Kids will enjoy the interactive game with beautiful images and funny sound clips,and adults can be nostalgic while playing with pokemons from their childhood times. There is an information about pokemons section with details of strength, weakness, speed etc., for more enthusiastic players, who wants to learn and know more while they play. 

Check [Wikipedia]() of Pokemon to know more about them.

## **UX**

### **1.Strategy**

The aim of building this memory game is to test my knowledge of **Javascript** and learn more in the building process. The Pokemon is selected for the memory game because they are very famous game characters and whoever plays online games knows them. I wanted a simple game that has rules which are easy to understand and the site is easy to navigate through.

### **2.Scope**

I wanted to make memory game which is easy to play and images should be different from each other, so that it will test the memory of the user.

There will be one **Score Counter**, one **Restart** button and one **Music Off** button to control the sound of the game (it can be muted).

After finishing the game, one popup message will show the **Moves** taken and **Stars** gained during the game.

There will be a **Timer** which will show the time taken to complete the game in minutes and seconds.

The site will have information about the Vital Statistics of the pokemon used in the game.

There will be a Contact Form to get feedback from the players and links to Social Networks will also be there.

### **3.Structure**

This website will be a three page website, linked to each other through Navigation Bar. The website will have a fixed **Navigation Bar**, that will have brand name and menu links( *Home, Pokemons, Contact*). The Header section will have Introduction of the game, How to play instructions, Moves and match counter, one timer to show the game timing in minutes and seconds, one star counter (which will show 3 stars for less than 14 moves, 2 stars for moves between 14 and 22, and 1 star for moves more than 23). 

The memory game will be on Home page, because that is the main feature of the site. Second page will have *Pokemon selector dropdown box* which will be designed by using **JavaScript** and it will show different types of Pokemon and their Vital statistics in a **Progress bar** after selection.

The last page will have one *Contact Form* to give feedback about the game and the website.

Footer will be fixed in the bottom and will have links to my social account.

### **4.Skeleton**

*Wireframe* : The wireframe for this 3 page project was made for three screen sizes(Mobile View, tablet view and Laptop view). Each page is shown in all three screen sizes in a single page for better understanding of the responsiveness of the page.

The Wireframe for this project can be seen here ![wireframe]().

*Fixed Navigation Bar* : Menu heading pointing to each of the 3 pages.

*Home, Pokemons and Contact pages*.

*Footer* with social media links shown by their fontawesome icons.

### **5.Surface**

**Colours**:

The colour theme is selected from original Pokeball colours. The background colour is kept Greyish Blue(#ccd4d4), Navigation and footer colour is Dark Red (#BD0107) and font colour is kept black(#000) and white(#fff) according to the background.


**Typography**:

Google Font **Lato** with fallback of **sans sarif** is selected for the entire project. (This font was choosen because this is the font of Pokemon go Official site)
