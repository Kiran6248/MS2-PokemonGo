**Pokemon go** is a memory game, built by me for my Second Milestone project for Code Institute.

It also has some descriptions about the *pokemon*. This site is made by using **HTML**, **CSS**,  and **Javascript**.

## **Overview**

This project is made by using famous **Pokemon**, also known as *Pocket Monsters*. They are managed by "The Pokemon Company" founded by "**Nintendo**". The purpose of this project is to make a fun memory game both for kids and adults. Kids will enjoy the interactive game with beautiful images and funny sound clips, and adults can be nostalgic while playing with pokemon from their childhood times. There is information section about the pokemon  with details of strength, weakness, speed, etc., for more enthusiastic players, who want to learn and know more while they play. 

Check [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon) of Pokemon to know more about them.

## **User Stories**

**The suitable users for his site will be 5+ kids and adults.**

* As a kid, I want to play easily and also see my score.
* As a kid, I want to see pictures of my favorite pokemon and recognize them.
* As a kid, I want to know how much time I took to finish the game.
* As a kid, I want to restart the game if I make a mistake.
* As an adult, I want to catch my favorite pokemon once again.
* As an adult, sometimes I don't want any background sound and want to mute everything.
* As an adult, I want to learn about the vital statistics of pokemon.
* As an adult, I want to contact the maker of the game and give my feedback.
* As an adult, I want to easily navigate through pages.

## **UX**

### **1.Strategy**

The aim of building this memory game is to test my knowledge of **Javascript** and learn more in the building process. The Pokemon is selected for the memory game because they are very famous game characters and whoever plays online games knows them. I wanted a simple game that has rules which are easy to understand and the site is easy to navigate through.

### **2.Scope**

I wanted to make a memory game that is easy to play and images should be different from each other so that it will test the memory of the user.

There will be one **Score Counter**, one **Restart** button, and one **Music Off** button to control the sound of the game (it can be muted).

There will be a **Timer** that will show the time taken to complete the game in minutes and seconds.

After finishing the game, one popup message will show the **Moves** taken and **Stars** gained during the game and also the **Time taken** to complete the game.

The site will have information about the Vital Statistics of the pokemon used in the game.

There will be a Contact Form to get feedback from the players and links to Social Networks will also be there.

### **3.Structure**

This website will be a three-page website, linked to each other through Navigation Bar. The website will have a fixed **Navigation Bar**, that will have the brand name and menu links( *Home, Pokemon, Contact*). The Header section will have Introduction of the game, How to play instructions, Moves and match counter, one timer to show the game timing in minutes and seconds, one star counter (which will show 3 stars for less than 14 moves, 2 stars for moves between 14 and 22, and 1 star for moves more than 23). 

The memory game will be on the Home page because that is the main feature of the site. The second page will have a *Pokemon selector dropdown box* which will be designed by using **JavaScript** and it will show different types of Pokemon and their Vital statistics in a **Progress bar** after selection.

The last page will have one *Contact Form* to give feedback about the game and the website.

Footer will be fixed at the bottom and will have links to my social account.

### **4.Skeleton**

*Wireframe*: The wireframe for this 3-page project was made for three screen sizes(Mobile View, tablet view, and Laptop view). Each page is shown in all three screen sizes on a single page for a better understanding of the responsiveness of the page. The initial design of the wireframe does not have moves, matches, and star counter. The timer was also not planned. During the development of the project, I decided to add all these features to make the game look more interactive. The pokemon page also had a different layout. It was planned to show images of all the pokemon and then show details after clicking on them. But during the development one dropdown selector was added to make a page look cleaner.

The Wireframe for this project can be seen here.

*Fixed Navigation Bar*: Menu heading pointing to each of the 3 pages.

*Home, Pokemon, and Contact pages*.

*Footer* with social media links shown by their font awesome icons.

### **5.Surface**

## **Features**

**Navigation Bar**
