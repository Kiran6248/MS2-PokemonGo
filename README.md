## **Overview**

This project is made by using famous **Pokemons**, also known as *Pocket Monsters*. They are managed by "The Pokemon Company" founded by "**Nintendo**". The purpose of this project is to make a fun memory game both for kids and adults. Kids will enjoy the interactive game with beautiful images and funny sound clips,and adults can be nostalgic while playing with pokemons from their childhood times. There is an information about pokemons section with details of strength, weakness, speed etc., for more enthusiastic players, who wants to learn and know more while they play. 

Check [Wikipedia]() of Pokemon to know more about them.

## **UX**

### **Strategy**

The aim of building this memory game is to test my knowledge of **Javascript** and learn more in the building process. The Pokemon is selected for the memory game because they are very famous game characters and whoever plays online games, knows them. I wanted a simple game whose rules are easy to understand and site is easy to navigate through.

### **Scope**

I wanted to make memory game with 3 levels of difficulties. **Easy**, **Medium** and **Hard**. 
**Easy** level will have 8 cards game.
**Medium** level will have 12 cards and **Hard** level will have 16 card game.

There will be one **Score Counter**, one **Restart button** and one **Sound** button to control the sound of the game (it can be muted).

 The site will have information about the Vital Statistics of the pokemon used in the game.

There will be a Contact Form to get feedback from the players and links to Social Networks will also be there.

### **Structure**

This website will be a single page website with 3 main sections. The website will have a fixed **Navigation Bar**, that will have brand name and menu links( *Home, Pokemons, Contact*). The Header section will have Introduction of the game, How to play instructions, Difficulty level selector dropdown box and one Score Counter. 

The memory game will be on home page, because that is the main feature of the site. Second page will have *pokemon selector dropdown box* which will be designed by using **JavaScript** and it will show different types of Pokemons and their Vital statistics after selection.

The last page will have one *Contact Form* to give feedback about the game and the website.

Footer will have links to my social account.

### **Skeleton**

*Wireframe* : Single page website with 3 main sections.

*Fixed Navigation Bar* : Menu heading pointing to each of the 3 pages.

*Home, Pokemons and Contact pages*.

*Footer* with social media links shown by their fontawesome icons.

### **Surface**

**Colours**:

Pokemon colours Yellow, Brown and blue are selected as dominant colour.

**Typography**

Google Font **Lato** with fallback of **sans sarif** is selected for the entire project. (This font was choosen because this is the font of Pokemon go Official site)

**Images**
